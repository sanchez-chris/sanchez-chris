### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Im Christian. Im driven by a deep inner motivation to continuously grow both personally and professionally. At the age of 22, I moved to Germany without any knowledge of the language, an experience that significantly strengthened my adaptability and resilience. Studying mechatronics I fall in love with software development and made it my job. My interest are full-stack development, IIoT and cybersecurity.
