### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Christian. I am driven by a deep inner motivation to continuously grow both personally and professionally. At the age of 22, I moved to Germany without any knowledge of the language, an experience that significantly strengthened my adaptability and resilience. Studying mechatronics I fall in love with software development and made it my job.
