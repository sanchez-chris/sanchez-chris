### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Christian, a junior programmer currently finishing a Bachelor's Degree in Mechatronics Engineering. I am interested in part-time positions that would allow me to expand my knowledge and get hands-on experience in software development and particularly Web Development.

While studying, I work on side-projects that allow me to learn more about the latest technologies. I am particularly experienced and interested in frontend development, using JS, React and GIT amongst others.

I am very enthusiastic about learning, bringing value to a company and due to my constant work on side-projects, I'm very used to balancing studies with work, being very flexible on my schedule.
